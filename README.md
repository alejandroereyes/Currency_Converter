What do these files do?
-----------------------
The currency converter folder contains files that allow the user to create a new currency object and convert between diffrerent currencies.

Currently the converter holds a static set of conversion rates that were assembled on 5/21/15 - rates do not reflect actual current rates.


Where is everything?
-------------------------
Inside there are two folders; a lib folder holds the files for the currency class and for the converter class. The spec folder holds the testing files, one for the currency class and another for the converter class.


Where can I run these?
-----------------------
All files can be run from the command line.
